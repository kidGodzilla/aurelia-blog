  <h2>About This Blog</h2>

  <p>This blog is an attempt to build a tiny, real-world application using the Aurelia framework. It is based on an earlier project in Ember.js (<a
    href="https://ember2-blog.firebaseapp.com/" target="_ember">Ember 2 Blog</a>).</p>

  <p>I am quite impressed with my initial go at this framework. It's declarative, intuitive, & it feels like normal JavaScript (albeit the esNEXT kind). I will admit that I haven't done anything non-trivial with Aurelia, but I think this is a good start!</p>

  <p>Be warned that Aurelia is not yet a production-ready framework. The documentation is light, and the code is unstable (for example, the linter doesn't seem to work). Consider this an experiment at this point.</p>

  <p>That was part of a two-part tutorial application designed to introduce Ember 2.0 to Javascript developers new to the framework.</p>

  <p>For anyone who is using Ember.js for the first time, Ember 2.0 provides a fresh start. Removing the cruft and introducing simpler syntax, Ember 2.0 will eliminate redundancy and hopefully make it easier for newcomers to learn the framework.</p>

  <p>In these examples, weâ€™re going to build a very simple blog utilizing Ember-2.0, Ember-cli, Ember-data & Firebase. My aim is to create the simplest application possible in Ember 2.0 as an introduction to the framework. If you have any suggestions for this app.</p>
